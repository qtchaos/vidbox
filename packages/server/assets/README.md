# assets

This directory contains the video files for the videos being served, due to GitHub's file size limit, we can't include the files in the repository.

Additionally, filenames should be the IMDb ID of the movie but without the tt prefix and should include the .webm extension.

Example: tt0120737 -> 120737.webm
